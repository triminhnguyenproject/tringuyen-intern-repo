# Cyber Security Guidelines

## Research Question

**What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?**
Phishing emails, malwares, identity stealer, password attack.

**What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?**
No clicking on any malicious links and email, using long and complex password, preferably password manager.

**Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?**
If not, someone may use your computer for malicous act, stealing information, install malware.

**How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?**
Not clicking on them, report to the security team of the organization to warn everyone.

**What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?**
A long password using different type of character (string, number, special character). A password manager help you record and securely store all the password, you will only need to remember one master password.

**Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?**
Because if your password got stolen, the hacker could not easily access to your account, they still need one more step verification which is on your phone. You should enable it whenever possible.

## Reflection

**What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?**
I currently follow the strong password practice, with 2FA enable. I always avoid clicking on weird and suspicious links that I receive through emails or messages.
I could probaly improve by locking my computer whenever I away from my desk.

**How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?**
I need to follow the secure practice everyday, not just when needed. I could also create some kind of notes / reminder that I could see everyday so that I always have security in mind.

**One new Cyber Security habit I will follow at Focus Bear**
Locking my computer whenever I busy and cannot monitor the machine or away from the computer.
