# AI Usage Guidelines

## Research Question

**What AI tools are typically used for your role?**
Mostly LLM models like ChatGPT or Gemini to research information regarding cyber security policies, or technical information about IT security.

**What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?**
AI could help find relevant information very quick, and solve some simple task, therefore boosting productivity. However, the risk is that the provided information may not be very accurate. Furthermore, user may accidently input and leak confidential information to the AI.

**What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?**
API keys, account information such as username/email and password combination. Probably some other very personal information that could be trace back to a person, social security number, social ID or credit/debit card information.

**How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?**
You could use the same prompt with different LLM models to cross check the content, but this is not fully reliable, this step should only be used to check if there is any conflict information between models, this should raise a red flag. To make sure the information is reliable, you should use more search engine like Google beside AI to find specific information, make sure the content did exist and is correct.

## Reflection

**When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?**
AI should only be used to generate ideas and providing an overview of a topic, it should not be used to research specific information, AI could give you the headings of a topic but you should find the information on your own. With coding, AI should only be used to write small pieces of code with relatively simple function, you should be the one to combine all of the code into your own program. Unless you really know what you are doing and know how prompt, AI should never be used to singlehandedly write a whole big program.

**How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?**
Not using AI to complete all of the task for you, instead use it as a tools, help you find ideas, and topics, then further research for specific content on your own. If you are coding, only generate short and simple code pieces at a time and combine them on your own, this way you will be in control of what is generated, and you are not rely on AI as you are still the one doing the planning, AI just help you write code according to the idea that you provided, which you should understand yourself.

**What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?**
Not providing any sensitive data to AI when using it, including real name, password, API keys, social security number, ID number or credit card information. Only use dummies information of those sensitive data when using AI.

## Task

**Task to choose:**
Coding.

**Review AI output:**
It does require some small editing to correct with my wanted program, but as I just prompt for simple pieces of code, the editing and combining happen relatively quick and easy.

**One best practice to follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear:**
Not providing any sensitive data to AI when using, avoid leaking confidential information.
